Description: The King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ) is a disease-specific, 
  self-administered questionnaire designed specific to assess the impact of 
  Urinary incontinence on Quality of Life. The questionnaire was developed 
  by Kelleher and collaborators in 1997. It is a simple, acceptable and 
  reliable measure to use in the clinical setting and a research tool that 
  is useful in evaluating UI treatment outcomes. This package calculates
  scores for each dimension of the KHQ; converts KHQ item  scores to KHQ five
  dimensions (KHQ5D) scores; and also calculates the utility index of the KHQ5D.
