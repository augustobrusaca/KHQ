Description: The KHQ is a disease-specific, self-administered questionnaire 
  designed specific to assess the impact of Urinary incontinence (UI) on QoL. 
  The questionnaire was developed by Kelleher and collaborators in 1997. It is 
  a simple, acceptable and reliable measure to use in the clinical setting and 
  a research tool that is useful in evaluating UI treatment outcomes. This 
  package calculates scores for each dimension of the KHQ; converts KHQ item 
  scores to KHQ5D scores; and also calculates the utility index of the KHQ5D.
